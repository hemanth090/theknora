⚠️ NOTES/CLARIFICATIONS:

1. "Lightning Fast" - Groq is indeed fast, but actual speed depends on:
   - File size and complexity
   - Document chunking
   - Network latency
   - LLM response time

2. "10x Faster Than Manual Review" - Unquantified marketing claim
   - Not explicitly verified in code
   - Reasonable but subjective

3. "100% Private" - Technically accurate for files, but:
   - LLM processing requires Groq API connectivity
   - Groq API sees document content (not file metadata)

4. Database - Landing says "PostgreSQL" in tech stack but:
   - Backend uses in-memory vector store with JSON persistence
   - NOT PostgreSQL
   - ⚠️ INCORRECT CLAIM

5. Admin UI - Landing doesn't mention, but:
   - Analytics tab exists (but limited)
   - Full admin dashboard for file management not present

6. OCR Support - Landing doesn't mention:
   - Not available for image-only PDFs
   - Noted as future improvement

⛔ INACCURACIES FOUND:

1. Tech Stack Section Lists "PostgreSQL"
   - Should be: "In-memory Vector Store (JSON-backed)"
   - Impact: Low (tech detail, doesn't affect user experience)

2. No mention of limitations:
   - No offline LLM support (requires Groq API)
   - No image/OCR extraction
   - No multi-file batch upload

RECOMMENDATION:
Update tech stack section to remove PostgreSQL reference and clarify:
"Vector Store: In-Memory JSON Persistence"

Otherwise, the landing page is accurate and well-represents the product!
